        <h4>Choices regarding control of your personal information</h4>
        <ol start="13">
          <li>Where we have your consent to do so (e.g if you have subscribed to one of our e-mail lists or have
            otherwise indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us), we may send you
            marketing communications about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. You can
            'opt-out' of such communications if you would prefer not to receive them in the future.
          </li>
          <li>If your e-mail address has changed and you would like to continue to receive our e-mails, you will need to
            access your account and update your e-mail address information in your account and sign-up again for those
            e-mails that you want to receive.
          </li>
          <li>If we send e-mails with commercial content we will generally include an "unsubscribe" facility that you
            can use to opt-out of further communications – to opt-out, just follow the instructions in the e-mail. We
            might not include an opt-out facility in important operational and service-based e-mails concerning things
            like your purchases, the user terms, important updates and need-to-know messages. By using our site you
            agree that we do not need to include opt-out facilities in those messages.

        <h4>Cookies (not the type you eat!) and web analytics</h4>
        <ol start="17">
          <li>Cookies are used to enhance your use of the site, such as remembering that you are logged in. You are able
            to minimise or block cookies using the privacy settings in your internet browser, but this may restrict your

          <li>When you visit our site, there's certain information that's recorded which is generally anonymous
            information and may not reveal your true super-hero identity. The fancy term for this is 'web analytics
            information', and we only use this information for statistical and website development purposes and to
            improve our services to you. If you're logged into your account some of this information could be associated
            with your account. We're talking about the following kinds of details:

          <li>If you make your personal information available to other people, we can't control or accept responsibility
            for the way they will use or manage that information. There are lots of ways that you may find yourself
            providing information to other people, like when you post a public message on a forum thread, share
            information via social media, or make contact with another user via our site. Before making your information
            publicly available or giving your information to anyone else, think carefully. If giving information to
            another user via our site, ask them how they will handle your information. If you're sharing information via
